<h2 align="center">✨ Hi, I'm Dee</h2>

I'm a marketing director at [Cialfo](http://cialfo.co/) working on demand generation, operations, and product marketing. I spend my time between Singapore (where I grew up) and Chiang Rai, Thailand (where my family lives).

I'm a roguelike/lite nerd, speculative fiction writer, and I'm constantly hopping between a half-dozen somewhat completed side projects. 

### how i work
I like building, optimizing, and automating things—which means I refer to this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1205/) a lot. I doodle and write a lot of notes on paper to untangle my brain. Hopefully, this results in me being more organized. 

An extended analysis of my nuance and errata is available at the [how-to-dee](https://github.com/lyrium/how-to-dee) repo.

### get in touch
My personal site is [deemirai.com](deemirai.com) (currently under maintenance).
