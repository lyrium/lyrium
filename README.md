# dee mirai âœ¨
Heya. I'm Dee (she/her). I'm a marketing director at [Cialfo](http://cialfo.co/) working on demand generation, operations, and product marketing. I spend my time between Singapore (where I grew up) and Chiang Rai, Thailand (where my family lives) ðŸ™Œ 

I'm a roguelike/lite nerd, speculative fiction writer, and I'm constantly hopping between a half-dozen somewhat completed side projects. 

## how i work
I like building, optimizing, and automating thingsâ€”which means I refer to this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1205/) a lot. I doodle and write a lot of notes on paper to untangle my brain ðŸ–Œ Hopefully, this results in me being more organized. An extended analysis of my nuance and errata is in the [how-to-dee repo](https://github.com/lyrium/how-to-dee).

## get in touch
My personal site is [deemirai.com](deemirai.com) (currently under maintenance).
